        Now it's your time to shine, check out this 6 routines and train each group of muscle according to your plan! We recommend to go 3 times to the gym when you are beginning and do the 3 routines. When you progress, you increase it to 6 times, repeating the routines twice and rest Sunday. If you are at home, follow the video of the routine at home.
